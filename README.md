# Upwork Scraper
## Idea:
### Python script to scrape recently posted jobs on upwork.com, link them to a google sheet, and send a message with the hottest jobs through Telegram.

## Possible Future Work: 
<li> Upload the script to GCP/AWS and schedule it to run after specific period </li>
<li> Apply Multi-Threading to make it much faster in retrieving the result </li>
<li> Using another method for getting the page source rather than Selenium (running silently) </li>
